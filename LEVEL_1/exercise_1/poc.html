		 * synchronization of state in drawArrays(). The call to
		 * vertexAttribPointer sets the state to be "dirty" and the
		 * first call to drawArrays() sets up the state appropriately
		 * but exits early due to having a zero sized buffer. The 
		 * second call passes the point of early termination in the first
		 * because the state is no longer marked as dirty and we enter into
		 * the functionality that retrieves the buffer and dereferences the
		 * storage element ultimately calling a vfptr for the deallocated 
		 * object. Incidentally, the patch doesn't actually modify or change
		 * the bug itself, but stops the expression of it by ensuring that
